                <P> As a group of young men who have had thier far share of trials, we know lifes not easy. Espically trying to surive without anyone in your corner. I was luckily enuogh to run into the right group of guys at the right time! But with how the world is going today, people arent connecting the same anymore. <br> <br>
                It's having a huge affect on younger genertions Espically. The kids dont have a decent remodel anymore. When i was in my teens i just wanted to be like the rapper's, cool clothes, nice jewlery, crazy amounts of drugs.
                That's what i though success was.. could you blame me? i never had a personal remodel for life. I was just a scared boy trying to figure out this game called life. the worse part is i though i had to do it all by myself to be a man! <br> <br>
                after alot of trial and error, and tons of growth i ended up with the right people at the right time. If i never got outside of my comfort zone, i know i would be a nobody.
            <br>
            <br>
            The truth of the matter is all we had to do is change our mindset, and be goal driven and life started to turn around for us.
            We as the Founders know that anyone who really wants to change, is capabile of doing so. thats why we are currently in deveoplemt of an IOS app for daily goal tracking thatll be the first none profit goal tracker of its kind, basically think of it as the accountabiliy partner you never had! </P>

                <p id="intro">  Here at Boulder Bro's we know that anyone who is willing to commit to changing there life around is worth investing time, rescources and effort into.
                    <br>
                That's why our main goal is to be able to build a coumpound. Where people who are ready and commited to growth can come and stay free of charge. 
                <br> We don't want it to come off as a rehab, due to the fact these people are concuisely choosing to change their live's around by waking into the compound.
                <br> The main goal behind the compound is to be able to trasnplant these's struggling humans into a nurshing invermont, where they can thrive and learn some simple cheat codes to help in thier daily life's.</p>
